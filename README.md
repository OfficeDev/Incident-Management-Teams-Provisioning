# Introduction 
Organizations of all types need to respond to events and incidents, planned and unplanned. Responding in a standard and timely manner helps organizations achieve better outcomes and communications status to stakeholders. 

Planning for events includes templated documents, communication processes, reporting dashboards and task management. Today organizations may have all those documents and tools in separate portals and platforms. Microsoft Teams is a central hub for collaboration and brings together these documents and sites into one work area. 

With Microsoft Graph an event-specific Teams space is quickly provisioned by adding apps and populating templated documents from SharePoint libraries, insuring the event or incident is structured for execution and retention after it’s complete. 

This project demonstrates how to provision Microsoft Teams with pre-configured channels, naming  convention, templated documents, tab apps using Graph APIs, where all of the content management is configured in SharePoint lists. This project works across all types of Office 365 tenants, including Office 365 US Government Community (GCC).
